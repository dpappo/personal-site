  Lighthouse labs has been pretty wild. Honestly, it’s like school cranked up to 11. So, naturally, when I’m told I’ll have to write an app from the ground up, with a team and a team I have 0 control over? Well, I start thinking that’s going to be pretty wild too. And, maybe not in great ways, you know? A guy can get a little nervous. Thoughts spring to mind: “What if my teams lacks direction? What if I need to lead them? What if they don’t want to be led?” I think these are worries that are pretty normal for anyone who wishes to succeed, and, those who wish to succeed often find themselves in a position of rallying others to that charge. As such, I usually find myself having to be “that guy.”
  
  <br>
  <br>
  This time? I was not that guy. This time, Dan Pappo was that guy. And was he ever THAT GUY. No, like, seriously. 
  <br>
  <br>
  
  I’ve been in management positions for most of my life. Since I was about 16 I’ve been leading teams in business settings, mostly for the reasons mentioned above: I like succeeding and, often, that means having to take charge of things to make sure they are done well. So, I came to the table ready and willing to stand up, organize things, put a plan in motion. I did not have to. It was already done. Dan had a plan.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  Dan shows up out of nowhere like a literal roaring thunder. Hyperbolic metaphor? No. Dan showed up not only with ideas of what he wanted to do, but open ears and an open mind to what we wanted, too. He brought tools to organize us, from google docs, a slack channel. Walked us through trolls and other organizational interfaces. He catalogued our thoughts, our goals and our dreams. Anything I could have thought of that needed direction? He was twenty steps ahead and was ready willing and able to attuned any and all of this to the needs of the group.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  See, normally this kind of stuff worries me, you know? I’m particular. I like to do things certain ways. I like organizing… even if my methods are more like controlled chaos. Yet, here, no worries were to be had. There was no conflict. There was never a time where I felt stonewalled or unheard. I found myself fully immersed in a well organized and fluid working environment beyond anything I could have ever conceived and it just happened naturally. Dan wasn’t just our “team leader”, nah, he was “us” heart and soul. 
  
  <br>
  <br>
  Every meeting began with a smile, and every day ended with a literal raging fire in our hearts, ready to tackle the next days’ problems. Why? Because we had organized meet ups, every day, planned ahead of time and built to work with our schedules, across Canada. Every meet up was a friendly discourse, expertly organized without ever feeling like we were constrained. We had direction. We had clear, organized, direction. Exactly what you’d expect from a work setting, in a midterm, all constructed in relatively short time by a guy who we barely knew, at first. Never any lack of communication, never any confusion.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  Expectations. Goals. Results.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  There’s a certain skill involved in being the kind of leader people want to listen to and respect, without ever coming across as “that boss guy”. You know? It’s that fine line between camaraderie and respect. If you’ve ever lead a team, you know exactly what I mean. Dan nails this, right out the gate. 
  <br>
  <br>
  
  So, yeah. My worst nightmares about doing a coding bootcamp midterm? They never came to be — largely due to Dan’s outstanding skills as a manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  I’d 100% work with him again.
